<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>
    We reviewed experiments and studies available on stress and memory in an attempt to better understand the
    relationship between the two and how they affect one another. We mainly focused on how stress affects encoding,
    retrieval, and neurochemistry. We will present empirical findings of what brain parts are most affected by stress
    and how that affects encoding, retention, and retrieval. We found that stress negatively affects encoding. We also
    discovered that stress can increase encoding, inhibits retrieval, decreases the production of cortisol. So for all
    three topics, stress affects memory in either a negative or positive way.
</p>
<br />

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
    As students, we are expected to retain information we learned that day and apply it to our assignments or projects
    at a later time. Across all ages and occupations, individuals are stressed about what they have to do, which impacts
    their cognitive performance. How efficiently we encode, recall and apply the information we are presented, amidst
    competing stimuli, is evaluated by experiments previously conducted. The research we reviewed considers the
    biological and psychological relationship between stress and cognitive performance.
</p>
<br />

<h1>Background of Stress</h1>
<p>
    Stress is an instinctive behavior towards a high pressure situation that is caused by hormonal and neurological
    reactions throughout the body. Hormones such as cortisol, activate and allow us to progress through stressful
    situations (Corbett, Weinberg, and Duarte, 2017) with our immune systems paying the price. This decrease in immune
    system function results in sleep and eating disorders, as well as other dysfunctions in the brain (Swaab, Boa, and
    Lucassen, 2005). Stress is also linked to the body’s fight or flight response, this is what activate if something is
    threatening us. our bodies start to release hormones and we experience stress. Today we work to understand the
    effect of stress on the body, and how to reduce it through research and therapy.
</p>
<br />

<h1>Background for Memory</h1>
<p>
    When the body takes in sensory information via touch, smell, noise, image, or taste, the brain has a system to
    solidify the sensory information into long term memory or forget it all together; this ensures that non-essential
    memories are forgotten (Chang, Jo and Lu, 2011). First comes the registration for sensory information, called a
    stimulus. For example, when someone touches your shoulder, your body will send sensory information to your brain
    through neurons. Once in the brain the signal is transduced, “the translation of a sensory signal in the sensory
    system to an electrical signal in the nervous system” (Sandi, C., & Pinelo-Nava, M. T. , 2012).
</p>
<p>
    There are two memory groups that the brain can translate information into: short term and long term memory (Bisaz,
    Travaglia, and Alberini, 2014). The brain sends the message to the prefrontal cortex to be cycled into short term
    memory, which only lasts for 15-20 seconds. If the brain decides that the information is memorable or important, the
    message will travel to the hippocampus to be stored in long term memory (Bisaz, Travaglia, and Alberini, 2014).
</p>
<p>
    Recall is the process of the brain taking memories out of long term storage into working memory. Working memory
    lasts for the same amount of time as short term memory, except it is frequently used. Memory is adversely affected
    when either the encoding process (everything from stimulation to long term memory) is damaged, or the recall process
    (long term memory to working memory) is damaged. There are also chemical factors that affect memory, such as stress.
</p>
<br />

<h1>Effects on Encoding</h1>
<p>
    Encoding new memories during stress can both positively and negatively affect one’s encoding abilities. Stress can
    lead to stronger encoding, but this is not necessarily positive. Due to the survival advantages of remembering
    stressful situations, human evolution has caused stressful events to be recorded in more detail into memory (Nesse
    and Young, 2000). In 2008, Mather and Nesmith conducted an experiment in which participants were briefly shown
    positively arousing (it generated a happy response), negatively arousing (it generated a fearful response), and
    neutral pictures on a grid. The participants remembered the negatively arousing images more easily than neutral
    images (Mather and Nesmith, 2008). Stress can enhance classical conditioning, but only for negative stimuli (Shors,
    1992). An example of this is learned helplessness. While in some instances this can be advantageous, the same
    phenomena is also responsible for issues like PTSD (Shors,1992). Some studies have shown purely positive effects of
    stress on encoding. A 1974 study by Günther Bäumler showed that stress can increase your spatial explicit memory,
    which is the act of one consciously remembering your environment (Simpson, 2010). In this study the LGT-3 was used
    which is a test where participants had to memorize a route on a map in one minute while undergoing a stress
    stimulant and then recalling it. Encoding has also been shown to increase immediately after calming down from an
    extended stressful period (Schwabe and Vogel, 2010). This only happens for a short period of time (Vedhara, 2000)
    and when this period happens there is a decreased level of cortisol in saliva (Schwabe and Vogel, 2010). Other
    studies have found negative impacts of stress on encoding. When you are learning information, if you are under
    stress it can inhibit the function of long term potentiation. This strengthens synaptic neurons through activity.
    Long term potentiation is important in memory formation and encoding information into your long term memory (Bliss
    and Lømo, 1973). Other studies found that stress does not affect memory. Using the Montreal Imaging Stress Test
    (MIST) which is a series of mental math problems while having to deal with threat components. (Corbett, Weinberg,
    and Duarte, 2017). The trio found that between neutral, minimally negative aroused, and highly negatively aroused,
    there were minimal changes in memory or encoding and no pattern between the results (Corbett, Weinberg, and Duarte,
    2017). Examples of what might be included in the MIST is really world memory tasks that people do on a daily basis
    and the test gives varying time for the person to remember the task.

<h1>Effects on Retrieval</h1>
<p>
    Chronic stress inhibits memory retrieval in a variety of ways. By studying WWII soldiers, the researchers found that
    some soldiers had no recollection of the events that had occurred in the war (Elzinga and Bremner, 2002). In 2002,
    the information gathered by Torrie was assessed, and it was found that prolonged stress at high quantities can cause
    explicit disorders which can result in memory loss at the specific times they experience high amounts of stress
    (Elzinga and Bremner, 2002). After being stressed for a long period of time the process that encodes and retrieves
    memory won’t work properly(Schwabe and Vogel, 2010). This was tested by having one group undergo a mild stressor and
    take what is known as a free recall and recognition test 24 hours after learning. This basically means that the
    participants would learn information and encode it properly. Then, one group would undergo stress while the control
    group did not (Schwabe and Vogel, 2010).
</p>
<br />

<h1>Effects on Neurochemistry</h1>
<p>
    Stress has a variety of damaging effects on neurochemistry. One of the primary biological responses to stress is the
    release of cortisol. Cortisol is released in response to high blood pressure and blood sugar. Cortisol regulates
    blood pressure and controls metabolism. It is released when you’re stressed. All cortisol receptors are in the
    hippocampus, a major part of the brain associated with memory.
</p>
<p>
    The hippocampus is the part of the brain that is affected the most when under stress due to the amount of receptors
    in the hippocampus (Scoville and Milner, 1957; Asalgoo, Jahromi, Meftahi, and Sahraei 2015). In the hippocampus,
    both functional and structural damage is possible (McEwen 1999). One example of structural damage is atrophy (Lupien
    and Lepage, 2001), which is a degeneration of cells in the hippocampus, which leads to the loss of function in the
    hippocampus. Another example of structural damage is neurogenesis disorder (Lupien and Lepage, 2001), which is
    associated with schizophrenia (Simpson, 2010) and major depression (Shen, 2004).
</p>
<p>
    The increase in cortisol causes the reduction of dendrites, which is how neurons connect and communicate (Woolley,
    2001) as well as the amount of neurons, which means less connections among neurons resulting in decreased
    communication in the hippocampus (Sapolsky, Uno, Rebert, Finch, 1990). Cortisol also affects structural changes in
    the synaptic terminal which disables the hippocampus’ ability to reabsorb neurotransmitters (Sapolsky, Uno, Rebert,
    Finch, 1990). It decreases neurogenesis and the creation of new neurons in the hippocampus tissue. This ultimately
    has long term effects on the function of the hippocampus (Gould, 1998).
</p>
<p>
    A type of hormone called glucocorticoids are part of the body's natural adrenal gland that inhibits memory. Both
    cortisol and glucocorticoids are released when stressed. The highest concentration of glucocorticoids can be found
    in the hippocampus (Scoville and Milner, 1957). Glucocorticoids typically inhibit the hippocampus, prefrontal
    cortex, and the amygdala (Buchanan and Tranel, 2001). When glucocorticoids affect these brain parts, they inhibit
    cellular metabolism, which is a chemical reaction that keeps cells alive. Glucocorticoids can also make cells in the
    hippocampus increasingly sensitive to amino acids or neurotransmitters (Sapolsky and Pulsinelli, 1985). This can
    negatively affect the hippocampus because amino acids have been found to contribute to atrophy in the hippocampus
    (Maras, 2014). Lastly, glucocorticoids can increase glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter involved with memory,
    however an excess amount of it can lead to damage or death in a cell.

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>
    After looking at the sections of encoding, retrieval, and neurochemistry we now know that when stress is involved,
    encoding is affected positively and negatively. For retrieval, stress affects it negatively. In neurochemistry,
    stress inhibits it in multiple ways. Of the three subtopics studies the least amount of information was available in
    that field. Something to note is that the effects of memory when talking about retrieval had contradicting
    viewpoints in many different studies, so the results are unclear. Retrieval is very important and apply to students,
    veterans, and people across all occupations. To conclude, people need to further their knowledge in for retrieval is
    affected by stress. If we are able to understand this further it can help us understand the most productive way to
    memorize information without it getting lost and can help society become more productive as a whole.
