<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>
    Academic procrastination refers to the tendency to delay tasks related to one’s studies or schoolwork so that it is
    not fully completed by the due date or have to be rushed to be done (Orpen, 1998). Since these tasks take up time,
    especially tasks that are continually assessed throughout the school year, students tend to take the route of unduly
    rushing them or not submitting them in the appropriate time (Cerino, 2005); for this reason it is not seen as
    shocking that procrastination causes detrimental effects on students taking college courses (Orpen, 1998). Lack of
    knowledge has been demonstrated within the field of researching students’ academic procrastination ethics and level
    of self-efficacy in individuals.
</p>
<p>
    In Nicholson’s journal, sixty undergraduate psychology students were given a survey on how emotionally induced
    stress had an effect on procrastination. The survey also measured how stress induced a specific type of
    procrastination accompanied with certain negative emotions, such as anger or frustration (Nicholson, 2007). Previous
    studies by Idit Katz, in her journal on Motivation & Emotion, and Eunju Lee, who published an article in The Journal
    of Genetic Psychology, dealt with and conducted research on the motives and deeper understanding behind the reason
    why students procrastinate, yet failed to delve into the ideals and mindsets of the students. Such intricate studies
    have yet to be conducted. Researchers such as Juan Muñoz-Olano and Camilo Hurtado-Parrado have participated in these
    active studies on exploring the repercussions of procrastination on college students. However, no further effort has
    been made to reduce the population of high school students facing this problem. Muñoz-Olano and Hurtado-Parrado use
    data from their study titled “Effects of goal clarification on impulsivity and academic procrastination of college
    students” and report that “nearly 50% of the college population struggles with academic procrastination,” most often
    leading to college dropouts and emotional stress and difficulty (Muñoz-Olano, 2017). Procrastination has been found
    to result in lower achievement, higher levels of stress, and higher levels of anxiety according to Angela Hsin Chun
    Chu and Jin Nam Choi on their study regarding the positive effects of “active” procrastination behavior on attitudes
    and performance in school.
</p>
<p>
    The lack of procrastination research on high school students is problematic due to the fact that procrastination is
    a widespread problem among high schoolers. In fact, Caroline Senecal, Richard Koestner, and Robert J. Vallerand
    address the gap in the research discussing academic procrastination and self-regulation in their article in The
    Journal of Social Psychology. This problem has negatively impacted undergraduate students and others such as medical
    students, because of the stress experienced during and outside of class, as well as the work required of the
    students to be completed. An additional research study done by Uzma Kausar, Sonia Ijaz Haider, and Irfan Ahmed
    Mughal has addressed increased stress levels experienced by these undergraduate and college students; this
    examination was conducted with the effort to provide regulations to other medical colleges for developing coping
    strategies, so that stress can be used as a positive factor to improve students' academic performance. This,
    however, has not been examined on high school students. According to Katz, personal characteristics, such as
    self-regulation, self-efficacy, and self-esteem, have received the most attention as variables investigated in
    relation to or as causes of academic procrastination. That being said, it is confounding that a miniscule amount of
    studies have been conducted to test whether or not the same phenomenon of decreased work ethic with academic
    procrastination occurs in students younger than the college age. However, to determine this, the relationship seen
    between motivation and procrastination in college students must first be established to consequently understand a
    possibly similar correlation with high school students.
</p>
<p>
    Eunju Lee, researcher at Halla University, South Korea, examined the relationships of motivation and flow
    experience, colloquially known as being “in the zone,” to academic procrastination in 262 Korean undergraduate
    students who were tested based off of a survey they did on procrastination and motivation (Lee, 2005). Her results
    demonstrated that high procrastination was associated with lack of self-determined motivation. This result aligns
    with the results yielded by the authors of The Journal Of Social Psychology, who observed that the method students
    regulated their academic behavior was significantly associated with the extent to which they procrastinated. This
    study was replicated in previous research in showing that impulsive factors associated with fear of failure, such as
    anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem, were all related to increased levels of procrastination. However, the
    variables associated with academic procrastination were tested for a specific subject—psychology—and only reflected
    the students in that class. This result attests to the practicality of looking beyond the typical reasons of
    delaying work when considering motivational explanations of procrastination. The previous research done on
    undergraduates begs the question of whether these same conclusions can be drawn in regard to high school students.
</p>
<p>
    As previously stated, a gap regarding the topic of academic procrastination and self-efficacy has not been
    thoroughly examined, which has even been acknowledged by previous researchers. This provides a validation and
    justification on why this topic should be researched and emphasizes the problem. However, instead of comparing a
    massive population of undergraduate students, this research aims to examine whether a similar correlation is
    observed with high school students, which narrows down the demographic of people the research will consist of. By
    conducting this research and analyzing a possible trend between the data, it can be determined if the results
    observed will correspond with previously conducted studies. The hypothesis basis of this study was built from the
    results of various articles: it is predicted that procrastination will have a positive effect on honors students and
    a negative effect on non-honors students. From this data, future implications regarding the correction of this
    problem can be made. This analytical study is relevant to society because, as a generalization, many students tend
    to procrastinate in their school work (i.e. tests, homework, projects, etc,.). This study also assesses levels of
    academic procrastination and how different types of procrastination—active or passive—affect the ability to get work
    done efficiently.
</p>
<br />

<h1>Procedures</h1>
<p>
    To gain a self-reported measure of procrastination, a format similar to that used by the Solomon and Rothblum
    Procrastination Assessment Scale-Students (PASS) was used, where students’ frequency of procrastinating in the
    subject that is taught by the same teacher on a non-honors level and on an honors level was assessed. This survey
    involved acquiring information about individual students—characteristics, opinions, attitudes, previous experiences,
    habits—by asking them questions and charting their answers on a post-test survey. Students were asked "To what
    degree do you delay or leave this task till the last minute?" as this has been a question asked in a replicable
    study by Renee D. Reasinger and Sheila Brownlow, who conducted a study on procrastination as a function of
    motivation toward college work (Reasinger & Brownlow, 1997). The responses were measured on a 5-point scale ranged
    from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Students were additionally asked to rate the degree to which they
    procrastinate in an area of study if that is a problem and/or a recurrence for them along with if they intend to
    diminish their procrastination in that area. The behavioral measure for procrastination is the late or
    non-submission of work in: (a) a regular weekly homework in the chosen subject, or (b) a major project in the class
    chosen. A self-report measure of procrastination was also accounted for in the surveys (Appendix 1), as reflective
    questions based on the student’s individual habits towards studying in their home life were asked. To assess the
    frequency of academic procrastination, students were provided with an assignment which accurately prompts
    procrastination in students. Since two different groups will be tested—non-honors students and honors
    students—similar tasks, but not exactly identical, will be allocated in order to have an appurtenant comparison.
</p>
<p>
    To determine the reasons students delay academic tasks, participants were asked to read scenarios such as “If you
    procrastinate, do you believe you did better as a result of procrastinating?” and “you liked the challenge of
    waiting until the deadline” in order to reflect each participant’s perceptions of their own behavior. The
    justifications for procrastination found in the study include fear of failure, tendency of distraction, difficulty
    staying focused, lack of dedication, risk taking, and unwillingness were based on Laura Solomon and Esther
    Rothblum’s 1984 factor analysis on procrastination. These factors helped assess individual tendencies of each
    student. Students involved in the study were also asked to provide detailed descriptions of their procrastination
    ethics and the extent to which they procrastinate—if they do—on certain assignments. Within this questionnaire,
    participants were asked if there is a certain subject they choose to procrastinate on or whether they choose to
    procrastinate specifically for tests or for homework assignments in general. The possible low return rate of the
    questionnaires was taken into consideration as the study was limited in its demographics. Along with the low return
    rate of questionnaires, the unwillingness of participants and of students to sign consent forms was also taken into
    account.
</p>
<p>
    With the people that were willing participants in the questionnaire study, each response reflected their writing and
    reading skills and, perhaps, their misinterpretation of one or more questions (Beck, Koons, & Milgrim, 2000). This
    method was the most probable method to observe the patterns students might tend to take while procrastinating. By
    knowing the trends and plotting them using statistical analysis, the results were then allowed to be compared to the
    results seen in the articles. Anonymity of the students was kept by coding students and assigning each student in
    the study a different code that will still conceal identity but also allow for the observance of trends in the
    experiment. The teacher was emailed a spreadsheet containing a list of names of students assigned these specific
    codes, and then was instructed to randomize the list of students to ensure that the researcher would not know the
    identity of the student who received a certain grade; anonymity had to be taken into measure since this study
    involved high school students (legal minors) and required the need to collect parental consent from the chosen
    population of participants (sophomores, juniors, and seniors). Teachers were also recommended to adhere to an
    appropriate grading style, specifically one that did not involve giving bonus as that would compromise the results
    and would heavily shift them to a certain category. Upon the students completing the assignment, teachers were
    instructed to immediately pass out the coded surveys that belonged to each individual (code numbers represented a
    specific person). Once the surveys were completed, students were to directly place them into a secured folder so the
    teacher would not be able to look at them, as looking at the surveys could produce potential bias during the grading
    process, thus skewing the results.
</p>
<br />

<h1>Results</h1>
<p>
    This study set out to examine the motivational orientation and procrastination tendencies
    of students at different stages of the high school lifestyle. The groups tested were honors and non-honors students,
    and classification was done according to whether or not they procrastinated on the given task. The present
    hypotheses involved a series of comparisons between two distinct groups of people: non-procrastinators and active
    procrastinators. To test the hypotheses, two subgroups were created from the entire sample in a two-step process, as
    done in Angela Hsin Chun Chu’s Journal of Psychology study on procrastination (Chu & Choi, 2005). First,
    non-procrastinators were separated from procrastinators. Participants who scored a level of 3 or above (which was
    the midpoint of a 5-point Likert scale) on the academic procrastination scale as procrastinators, and categorized
    those who answered less than 3 as non-procrastinators. The questions were objectively asked and applied to the
    general population of participants, as the implementation of bias in the questions was avoided at all costs. In the
    sample of 55 participants, 25 were categorized as non-procrastinators, and 30 were categorized as procrastinators.
</p>
<p>
    In the second step, the groups of procrastinators versus non-procrastinators were further divided into honors
    students who procrastinated and those who did not, and non-honors students who procrastinated and those who did not;
    in other words, the groups in the first step were further divided into subgroups according to academic course level.
    This was done to help organize the chi-square chart to determine how the expected and observed values compared. The
    chi-square test helped to determine if procrastination is dependent or independent of course level; the t-test was
    used to examine if the grade received on the assignment had a correlation with the procrastination level.In the
    second step, the groups of procrastinators versus non-procrastinators were further divided into honors students who
    procrastinated and those who did not, and non-honors students who procrastinated and those who did not; in other
    words, the groups in the first step were further divided into subgroups according to academic course level. This was
    done to help organize the chi-square chart to determine how the expected and observed values compared. The

<p>Table 1 shows the t-test analysis run to determine the academic outcome of the students for each individual group and
    sub-group. For teachers of different course level subjects—since the probability of the events happening was greater
    than 0.05 (the number found in the study was 0.927) —it cannot be stated that procrastination is induced more in
    course level; significance was recorded for values less than 0.05. In the t-test conducted, it was found that for
    the group of honors students and comparing the amount that procrastinated to the amount that did not procrastinate,
    the results were significant, which means the null hypothesis can be rejected. The calculated p-value was 0.0039815,
    indicating that the results were significant when p &#60; 0.05. However, for the second data set comparing
    non-honors students who procrastinated to non-honors students who did not procrastinate, the p-value came out to be
    0.559138, thus indicating that the results were not significant enough at p &#60; 0.05.
</p>
<br />

<h1>Analysis</h1>
<p>
    Interrelationships among procrastination and academic achievement are presented in Table 1. The level p &#60; .05
    was considered as the cut-off value for significance. Academic achievement was significantly associated with
    procrastination variables, as seen in Eun Hee Seo’s paper on academic achievement (Seo, 2012). The findings from
    this study indicate that procrastination has an effect on grades to some students, specifically on honors
    students. However, there was no significant correlation between the course-level difficulty and amount of
    procrastination, as the observed and expected values (see Table 1) were almost identical. This leads to the
    conclusion that there is no correlation between course difficulty and the degree to which a student
    procrastinates. The first hypothesis of the study stated that individual beliefs, lack of guidance, and
    non-linear behavior in the aspect of dedication to a subject predict academic procrastination. This mindset was
    seen to additionally correlate with the mindset of college students in Caroline Senecal’s study of self
    regulation and academic procrastination (Senecal, 2016). The findings showed that although a lack for change,
    academic tendency, problem avoidance and emotional and psychological irresponsibility have a direct and
    significant relationship with academic procrastination, the irrational belief of helplessness for change can
    “positively predict academic procrastination and demand for approval can reversely predict academic
    procrastination” (Senecal, 1995).
</p>
<p>
    The first finding was that a lack of change of ethics has a direct, and significant relationship with academic
    procrastination. This conclusion was found on the basis of individual student responses gathered from the post-test
    survey questions. Also, with this conclusion, academic procrastination can be predicted to significantly have an
    effect on each individual person. This finding means that those who are affected by a lack of motivation in their
    tasks have procrastinating tendencies, which have an effect on their work. This finding is in line with the
    respective findings of Vincent Prohaska and Peter Morrill; Martyn Stewart; and Erin Westgate, who indicated that the
    lack of motivation of students with the procrastinating mindset ultimately affected the academic outcome. Thus, this
    indicates that lack of a means for change means that the person believes that past experience—at school or at
    home—and events determine one’s behavior. Such individuals have no need to create a change in their daily life
    because these changes would require changing their daily habits on procrastination, which these certain individuals
    believe has a prominent effect. Thus, students use past experiences and behaviors in current affairs and since this
    false belief and behavior causes many problems, students who continue procrastinating will eventually have adverse
    consequences; high schoolers will continue to procrastinate with the hope of still succeeding (Balkis, 2013).
</p>
<p>
    Results also indicated that honors and non-honors students tended to procrastinate with the mentality that the
    experience of feeling challenged enhanced their ability to complete the project. The feeling of being challenged
    “compelled” students to unduly finish the task with a successful outcome in mind. However, no relationship was found
    in this study between students’ procrastination and academic achievement in the non-honors group. Results in this
    study support the claim that there is no correlation between students’ tendency to procrastinate and their course
    level (honors or non-honors). In the study by Solomon and Rothblum, which analyzed the clinical practices adhering
    to procrastination, it was concluded that the “lack of correlation between self-reported procrastination and course
    grades may have been a methodological factor” (Solomon & Rothblum, 1984). They had asked each student to assess his
    or her own ability to procrastinate on academic activities without focusing on a specific course, whereas the
    students’ academic performance was based only on their grades in the introductory psychology course assessed, a
    different level (Solomon & Rothblum, 1984).
</p>
<br />

<h1>Conclusion and Future Implications</h1>
<p>
    From the findings gained in this study and of previous researchers, it can be concluded that although it is factors
    other than daily tendencies that prevent procrastinators from doing as well academically-speaking compared with
    non-procrastinators; students are deluding themselves to believe that procrastination has little to no impact on
    performance because it allows them to achieve a habit of doing the task in a delayed manner. Although it is not
    actually connected to increased academic achievement, the essence of procrastinating makes students feel as if
    studying effectively in a short time will lead to self-satisfaction in individual achievement. The short-lived,
    euphoric experience of completing the project on such a strict timeline prompts a sense of accomplishment and pride
    in students that regardless of the deadline, the assignment was finished in a “sufficient enough” manner. Therefore,
    an implication of the results in this study is that it is necessary for teachers to let students know that
    experiences of rushing a task in one sitting that result from cramming does not lead to high academic achievement.
</p>
<p>
    It is significant for future researchers to further investigate the factors involved in the general nature of the
    relationship between procrastination and academic achievement, such as psychological or emotional factors of home
    life, and how the home environment may trigger or sustain procrastination. Future investigators of this subject
    should also analyze how academic procrastination tendencies would also play a part in student home life and social
    life. Researchers could also analyze how these habits play a part in willingness to be social, especially for
    introverted and extroverted individual types, as delaying school work could reflect the proclivity of spending time
    with someone. The most significant limitations of this study are the gender demographic of the participants, as well
    as the number of participants. The majority of the participants were male high school students and the sample size
    was just 55 students. Therefore, the findings cannot be generalized to other student populations or to the high
    school female demographic. Further research is necessary in order to determine whether or not the findings may be
    generalized to other student populations or females. Other limitations should be considered in interpreting the
    findings of this study. For example, the sample group lacked diversity. Thirty of the fifty-five participants had a
    senior class standing, as well as differences in coursework, stress levels, and priorities, such as college
    applications. These factors likely influenced the self-report measures. Each school environment adheres to different
    regulations of assignments, especially those that typically induce procrastination. Thus, the motivation factors in
    this study differs from the population of another school.
</p>
<p>
    In this study analysis, academic motivation and self-efficacy were additionally found to significantly contribute to
    academic procrastination, indicating that students depend on the importance of being aware of one’s own motivations
    and habits and the confidence in one’s ability to succeed in an academic setting. This study’s results can inform
    plans to minimize procrastination among high school students, and possibly among the junior high demographic.
    Although there is a great deal more to be done in addition to this study, potential researchers can use this
    research as evidence to create informative programs to lower levels of academic procrastination in schools. These
    results, strengthened by the results of the studies reviewed, can help students achieve goals they make for
    themselves, both in and out of the class environment, to be completed on the due date successfully. Further research
    on this topic can increase knowledge on the relationship between academic procrastination and other variables such
    as perfectionism, self-control, and self-regulatory beliefs. For some, academic procrastination may be a beneficial
    strategy, as these procrastinators face less anxiety on turning in the task and less stress due to the fact that the
    deadline of the assignment is not taken into consideration for them, the deadline does not induce stress related
    tendencies (Senecal, 1995). The results of this study revealed that both motivation and personal upbringing and
    long-lasting habits have a joint impact on students’ tendency to procrastinate on academic tasks (Senecal, 1995).
    Academic procrastination is an overwhelming obstacle for many students, leading to scholastic problems and
    stress-related physical maladies, such as anxiety and depression (Orpen, 1998; Owens & Bowman, 2008).
</p>
<p>
    Researchers additionally must not ignore motivational influences that may have an added impact on academic
    procrastination when coupled with personality and self-regulatory variables. Each individual will continue to
    proceed with their current ethics, feeling as if their current habits will continue to benefit them as college
    approaches. Tactics and habits developed and used in high school will be the basis of how students deal with task
    stress, whether it is academic or non academic. Since procrastination was seen coupled with personality orientation
    in this study, home environments and outside influences could also trigger procrastination tendencies (or lack
    thereof). Without an exact understanding of what psychologically motivates students to start assignments and how
    such motivation (or lack thereof) influences their procrastination, “don’t do today what can be put off until
    tomorrow” will continue to be the slogan of many students–in the high school and college realm, and will continue to
    dominate the adolescent mindset.
