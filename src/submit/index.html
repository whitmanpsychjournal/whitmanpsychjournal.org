                    Authors should prepare manuscripts according to guidelines established in the Publication Manual
                    of
                    the American Psychology Association (6th ed.). The Journal reserves the right to modify APA
                    style.
                    Manuscripts should be no longer than 20 pages and must include a list of references as well as
                    parenthetical documentation in accordance with APA style. It is suggested that manuscripts
                    include
                    the following sections: abstract, introduction, methods, results and discussion. However,
                    manuscripts are not limited to these sections. Submissions should also include a cover letter in
                    which the author’s name, school affiliation, advisor’s name, address, phone number and e-mail
                    address are given.

                    Please be sure to use academic and professional sources while conducting your research. Many
                    university, public, and school libraries offer both printed and online sources from professional
                    journals.
