    <p>The Whitman Journal of Psychology is a non-profit, student-run publication. We collect submissions from high
        school students around the country and publish the most intriguing and well written submissions that we
        receive. We consider every submission and are always looking for new articles, so we encourage students to
        submit their work.</p>
