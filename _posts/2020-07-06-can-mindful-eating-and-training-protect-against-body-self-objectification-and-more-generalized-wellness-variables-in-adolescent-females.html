	<h1>Abstract</h1>
</p>
</p>
<p>Mindfulness can be defined as a state of being attentive and aware of what is happening in the present moment.
	Mindful eating has been used to treat eating disorders. 174 subjects at an all-girls academy completed mindful
	eating, objectified body-consciousness, and psychological wellness surveys. BMI was the covariate. The research
	design for Study I employed multivariate analyses of variance (MANCOVA’s) to compare the three Mindful Eating
	subscales across the two OBC subscales and an ANOVA against the single wellness variable. Body Mass Index (BMI) was
	used as a covariate in the MANCOVA’s. The same analyses were conducted with self-esteem (SE) as a dependent
	variable. Girls with higher disinhibition, higher awareness, and lower distraction scores reported significantly
	lower (healthier) levels of body image dysfunction (two OBC subscales) across a majority of variables relative to
	peers who did not self-report mindful-eating practices (five of six p’s<.05). Those who reported higher
		mindful-eating practices displayed less dissatisfaction and criticalness towards their bodies. Mindful eating
		manifested no significant effect on self-esteem or overall wellness (all p’s>.05). Phase II was a
		quasi-experimental project which taught participants how to eat mindfully by watching a three-minute mindfulness
		training video. Surveys were immediately retaken. In Phase II, counter to prediction, no significant change in
		any dependent variable occurred in either experimental or control populations after several within-subject
		analyses of (co)variance (all p’s >.05).</p>

	<h1>Introduction</h1>
</p>
<p>Mindfulness can be defined as a state of being attentive and aware of what is happening in the present moment
	(Kabat-Zinn, 2003; Brown and Ryan, 2003). Several studies have shown that cultivating mindfulness may enhance
	psychological well-being (Baer <span class="is-italic">et al</span>., 2008; Bajaj, Gupta, & Pande, 2016).
	Individuals who reported greater mindfulness were less likely to report negative emotions and low self-esteem
	(Bajaj, Gupta & Pande, 2016). Since mindfulness heightens one’s ability to be aware and attentive in the present
	moment, one is less likely to manifest negative emotions and critical thoughts. This tends to improve one’s
	self-esteem and positive emotion (Pepping, O’Donovan, & David, 2013; Leary & MacDonald, 2003). Self-esteem also
	plays a key role in augmenting a person’s positive well-being (Bajaj, et al., 2003). While mindfulness is shown to
	improve psychological well-being, it has also been employed as a method to monitor the process of eating.</p>

<p>The action of mindful eating includes focusing on the process of eating through being aware of all stimuli and
	recognizing environmental triggers that initiate and cease eating (Albers, 2008). In addition, through
	mindfulness-based eating awareness training, individuals may experience a heightened ability to resist compulsive
	and mindless eating (Kristeller, 2003; Moor, Scott, & McIntosh, 2012). Through consistent and daily mindfulness
	meditation, one can condition one’s innate skills of awareness and attention to improve these abilities (Kabat-Zinn,
	2003). Mindfulness can be practiced in daily life through basic actions: such as walking, bathing, and eating (Baer
	& Krietemeyer, 2006). By being attentive during such actions one can improve one’s ability to make decisions and
	increase one’s sense of control. Mindful eating has been used to treat eating disorders including binge eating
	disorder and bulimia nervosa. Studies conducted by Kristeller and Hallett (1999) and Proulx (2008) respectively,
	illustrate the reduction of binges, an augmented sense of control overeating, and an increased ability to detect the
	difference between satiety and hunger. These studies also had positive effects on the mental state of its
	participants through the reduction of anxiety, depression, and emotional distress. Specifically, in Kristeller and
	Hallett’s study (1999), participants increased a sense of control and self-worth and general mood.
</p>

<p>Western cultures thoroughly engender female body dissatisfaction from childhood to adulthood. The unrealistic images
	of skeletal models are ubiquitous throughout the media. Because negative attitudes toward more overweight
	individuals are heavily prevalent in society, dieting is portrayed as a “normal” method to combat fatness. This
	resolutely advances the idea that being thin is not only preferable but also quite attainable for the majority of
	average-sized females through dieting. It is through the women who fail to conform to these unattainable beauty
	standards that they feel that they are abnormal. Through this false sense of abnormality, women can experience the
	psychological and physical repercussions for the inordinately high standards of Western society (Garner, et al.,
	1980; Thompson & Heinberg, 1993; Thompson, & Heinberg, 1999; Kahumoku, et al., 2011).</p>

<p>The attempts of females to conform to unfeasible standards of beauty are rooted in the significant pressures applied
	by Western society. The effects of impractical Western beauty standards for women often lead to self-objectification
	and internalization. It is stated in Fredrickson and Roberts’ self-objectification theory that females, both young
	and old, see themselves as objects made only to please others (1997). Additionally, the “thin-ideal
	internalization,” concept was created to depict the deleterious internalization of Western standards of females
	(Thompson and Stice, 2001). This “thin-ideal internalization” engenders itself within individuals due to the common
	approval of such standards from significant others, family, peers, and the media itself. The internalization of such
	unrealistic standards consequently results in body dissatisfaction for most women who cannot conform to the
	impossibly high standards of their society. Women are then left with burdensome feelings of being abnormal and
	utterly uncomfortable in their own skin. Females who are unable to attain such absurd standards implemented by their
	society generally develop a strong sense of body dissatisfaction (Thompson and Stice, 2001). Female body
	dissatisfaction can also be magnified through the media’s rigid picture of an ideal women which mirrors the American
	vision of beauty by heightening the desirability of a thin woman leaving women who do not reflect this image
	unsatisfied with their bodies (Cash and Henry, 1995; Freedman, 1984).</p>

<p>It is because of this unattainable vision of what a woman should look like, that young females have been plagued by
	unparalleled levels of discontentment in oneself. In fact, scholars from several disciplines have argued that both
	electronic and print media unduly influence body and weight issues (Evans et al, 1995; Jacobi and Cash, 1994; Polivy
	and Herman, 1985; Silverstein et al, 1986; Stein and Reichert, 1990; Stice et al, 1994; Wooley and Wooley, 1984).

	<h1>Hypotheses</h1>
</p>
<p>This study examines the relationship between mindful eating and a) objectified body consciousness b) self-esteem c)
	general well-being. Can mindful eating serve as a protective factor in adolescent females? Phase I will be a
	between-subjects, cross-sectional test of girls aged 14-18 at an all-girls private school that draws its population
	from 90% of the public school districts in New York State's Nassau County, a suburb of New York City. Phase II
	involves a single mindfulness training session offered in 10th grade health class, followed by a new round of
	surveys. Longitudinal analyses of the classes of 2020 and 2021 (untrained) and 2022 (trained) will be conducted in
	Fall 2019.</p>
<p class="has-hanging-indent">Phase I:</p>
<p>1. Higher levels of mindful eating will curb the negative effects of body shame and surveillance.</p>
<p>2. Higher levels of mindful eating will positively influence teenage girls’ self-esteem.</p>
<p>3. Adolescent females who exhibit a higher level of mindful eating will report higher generalized mental well-being.
</p>

<p class="has-hanging-indent">Phase II:</p>
<p>1. Adolescent females who do not undergo mindful-eating training will not report significantly increased scores
	across SE, OBC, and WEMWBS variables.</p>
<p>2. Adolescent females who undergo mindful-eating training will report significantly increased scores across SE, OBC,
	and WEMWBS variables.</p>

<p class="has-text-centered not-too-wide">
	<h1>Method</h1>
</p>
<p class="has-hanging-indent"><u>Phase I</u></p>
<p>
	Participants were enrolled in an all-girls private school that draws its students from 42 different public-school
	districts in four counties (Nassau, Suffolk, Queens & Kings) n=174 | (female=174). After consent was obtained, 174
	girls (mean age: 15.7) completed a survey packet that included the Objectified Body Consciousness Survey, the
	Mindful Eating Questionnaire, Rosenberg’s Self-Esteem Inventory and Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale
	(WEMWBS).
</p>
<p class="has-hanging-indent"><u>Phase II</u></p>
<p>
	In Phase II, 92 females, from the same cohort, engaged in a mindfulness training session wherein 42 girls watched a
	three-minute video describing how to mindfully eat. Fifty girls did not watch a video. All 92 participants completed
	the same survey packed as in Phase I ninety days later.

<p class="has-text-centered not-too-wide">
	<h1>Procedure</h1>
</p>
<p>
	Phase I commenced after informed consent forms were returned. Girls in health, gym, and study hall periods were
	administered a 10 to15 minute anonymous survey which was composed of 4 individual instruments: the Mindful Eating
	Questionnaire, the Objectified Body Consciousness Survey, Rosenberg’s Self-Esteem Inventory and the
	Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (WEMWBS). For Phase II, a three-minute mindful eating video (Eat
	Mindfully) from Cheryl Jones MA., CEO, the Mindful Path, was administered to the experimental cohort in their health
	classes by the student researcher. After the video, participants of the experimental and control populations
	promptly retook the survey. A 2019 consent form was obtained from all subjects. Following the completion of the
	surveys, all data was coded, scored, and entered into an Excel database for analysis.

<p class="has-text-weight-bold">See Appendix Table 11-14</p>

<p class="has-hanging-indent"><u>Phase I</u></p>
<p>The research design for Study I employed a multivariate analysis of variance (MANCOVA to compare the three
	Mindful Eating subscales across the two OBC subscales and the single wellness variable. Body Mass Index (BMI) was
	used as a covariate. The same analyses were conducted with self-esteem (SE) as a dependent variable. Those girls
	with higher disinhibition, higher awareness and lower distraction scores reported significantly lower (healthier)
	levels of B.I.D. across a majority of variables relative to peers who did not self-report mindful-eating practices
	(five of six p’s <.05). There were no significant levels of wellness or self-esteem reported in response to higher
		mindful eating scores (all p’s>.05). See tables 2-5.</p>

<p class="has-hanging-indent"><u>Phase II</u></p>
<p>
	Phase II sported a quasi-experimental within subjects’ design. This phase sought to teach experimental
	participants how to mindfully eat by watching a three-minute training video. Surveys were immediately retaken.
	Unexpectedly,no significant change in any dependent variable occurred in either experimental or control populations
	(all p’s >.05). See tables 6-13.</p>

<p class="has-text-centered not-too-wide">
	<h1>Discussion</h1>
</p>

<p class="has-hanging-indent"><u>Phase I</u></p>
<p>MANCOVA-based evidence that mindful eating variables predicts significantly lower levels of body dissatisfaction
	(even though they did not impact self-esteem or general wellness) is important – to psychologists, parents, and
	educators. Consistent with Bajaj, Gupta & Pande (2016), this finding may be because girls who reported greater
	mindfulness were less likely to report negative emotions. However, we did not find a direct link to self-esteem.
	Mindfulness did demonstrate strong significance in combating body objectification. Clearly, teaching girls to
	mindfully eat in a purposeful, systematic way ought to promote healthy body image especially in a society that
	is plagued by impossibly high beauty standards for females. Following the lead of recent scholars, the next step is
	to develop a simple and effective method for teaching young women mindful eating through mindfulness-based eating
	awareness training. (Kristeller, 2003; Moor, Scott, & McIntosh, 2012). Can a brief intervention be distilled from
	the long-term quasi-experimental protocols employed by these scholars?</p>

<p class="has-hanging-indent"><u>Phase II</u></p>
<p>The introduction of mindful eating exercise to the experimental cohort led to no significant gains in
	self-esteem, objectified body consciousness, or mental wellbeing of the young ladies. While the three-minute video
	was reasonably engaging and factually correct in all respects, its brief duration and non-participatory format may
	have limited the impact its training had on the participants. We suggest that future projects could involve
	following a protocol such as Jon Kabat-Zinn’s (2003) 8-week Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction course for
	cultivating mindfulness. Utilizing Kabat-Zinn’s 8-week Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction program, participants
	would learn mindfulness tactics for twenty minutes daily, preferably in their secondary health classes. Through
	consistent and daily mindfulness meditation, one’s innate skills of self-awareness would be conditioned (Kabat-Zinn,
	2003). Although such training sessions would not directly teach mindful eating, as did the brief training video used
	in Phase II, by cultivating one’s mindfulness it will indirectly push participants to remain in tune with their
	senses during many daily activities, especially while eating.</p>
<p>Through direct and consistent contact, and more engaging training sessions, participants’ greater interest in
	mindfulness might lead to cultivation of mindful eating habits. Unlike Phase II's simple three-minute training
	video, following a more expansive 8-week course would promote improved mindfulness tactics. This, in turn,
	should
	lead to increased levels of self-esteem, general mental well-being, and decreased objectified body
	consciousness. As
	demonstrated in Phase I, <span class="is-italic">effectively</span> cultivating mindful eating can help female
	adolescents break the cycle of conformity to the increasingly rigid, and physically unrealistic, beauty
	standards
	prevalent in Western society (Garner, <span class="is-italic">et al></span>., 1980; Thompson & Heinberg, 1993;
	Thompson, & Heinberg, 1999; Kahumoku, <span class="it=italic">et al</span>., 2011). Phase II did not effectively
	improve mindful eating habits in our adolescent female sample and consequently did not have a significant effect
	on
	one’s body image. Through a more consistent and engaging mindfulness training, participants could benefit not
	only
	from enhanced mindful eating skills but also from a healthier body image as seen in Phase I.</p>
