    The lack of knowledge from researchers, misinformation from the media, and the disruption of daily life has
    resulted in heightened stress and anxiety levels during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak. Government
    officials across the country are taking precautionary steps in attempt to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus:
    closing schools, movie theaters, bars, gyms, and limiting services provided by restaurants.. Although these measures
    were taken in the best interest of the general public, hearing of such extensive measures induced feelings of
    uneasiness and fear for many.

    Researchers have recently suggested that COVID-19 originated from a live animal market in Wuhan, China, the capital
    of the Hubei Province. The first diagnosed case of coronavirus was on November 17, 2019. The disease stayed
    relatively contained in Wuhan until early January, when South Korea announced its first possible case on January 8,
    2020. Over two months later, the World Health Organization has confirmed 198,229 cases.

    People across the world continue to feel anxious as the uncertainty of the situation grows. An infographic released
    by the <a href="https://uhs.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/fearsanxiety-coronavirus.pdf">University of California
        Berkeley</a> entitled “Managing Fears and Anxiety around Coronavirus” cites that
    feelings of “anxiety, worry, panic, helplessness, anger, and hypervigilance to your health and body” are common
    reactions to this global pandemic. Pandemics are not just a <a
        href="https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/psychiatrists-beware-impact-coronavirus-pandemics-mental-health">physical
        phenomenon</a>, they affect people mentally in a
    plethora of ways. Across the U.S., grocery stores have run out of supplies such as toilet paper and water which has
    only set people into more of a panic. Many people are participating in “panic buying” in an effort to regain some
    sense of control.

<p class="no-indent">
    With so much unknown, it is crucial to take the time to focus on the things you can control. In times like these, it
    is easy to feel helpless and hopeless. <a
        href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/managing-stress-anxiety.html">The CDC</a> acknowledges
    the stress and anxiety produced by the recent outbreak
    and even proposes numerous tips for managing this stress and anxiety. One tip provided is to take occasional breaks
    from the media, as the CDC recognizes that “hearing about the pandemic repeatedly can be upsetting”. It is easy to
    get wrapped up in headlines and fixate on alarming numbers. Therese J. Borchard, an associate editor with Psych
    Central, provides detailed <a
        href="https://psychcentral.com/blog/reduce-your-anxiety-this-minute-3-different-types-of-deep-breathing/">instructions</a>
    on various breathing exercises like coherent breathing,
    resistance
    breathing, and breath movement. Breathing exercises can help refocus attention away from negative worries.
</p>
<br />
<p class="no-indent">
    Another strategy for managing anxiety during the coronavirus is to embrace the free time. The absence of obligations
    and a rigid schedule provides time for self-care. Barbara Markway provides countless ways to <a
        href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/shyness-is-nice/201403/seven-types-self-care-activities-coping-stress">prioritize
        one’s self</a>.
    A few examples that Markway proposes are: taking a hot shower, completing crossword puzzles, journaling, writing
    down feelings, practicing self-compassion, trying yoga, and face-timing a friend. Other health professionals
    recommend exercise to keep the body moving, as well as meditation to ease the mind during these difficult times.

<p class="no-indent">
    It’s easy to lose perspective when there is a global pandemic going on. Of course, this should be taken extremely
    seriously, however, perspective will help ease anxious minds. Prepare, prepare, prepare, but not too much. The CDC
    and World Health Organization (WHO) suggest washing your hands for 20 seconds with soap and warm water. This is the
    most effective way to combat the virus. As previously stated, hoarding supplies like toilet paper and water bottles
    only takes away from the people who actually need said items. Additionally, the increase in demand for masks despite
    the fact that masks have no scientific backing in regards to their effectiveness in warding off disease, further
    proves that the public oftentimes blows things out of proportion.

    Events that shake the entire world, much like this global pandemic, are rare to come across. For decades
    psychologists have studied the impact of traumatic events on local communities. Generally speaking, natural
    disasters unify and foster empathy among communities. In Seville, Spain, a city greatly impacted by COVID-19,
    <a
        href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/03/16/under-quarantine-balconies-around-world-set-stage-dj-sets-squats-singing/">residents
        were filmed working out together from their balconies</a>. Along similar positive lines, an example of a
    natural disaster fostering empathy was demonstrated in <a
        href="https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/were-only-human/unshakable-humanity-altruism-and-disaster.html">China’s
        Sichuan</a> province when in 2008, a major earthquake
    devastated hundreds of thousands. Psychological scientists who were already working in the area when the earthquake
    hit seized the opportunity to “explore what happens to our noblest impulses under severe environmental insult”
    (Association of Psychological Sciences). The psychological scientists were amazed when they discovered that
    9-year-olds (through a series of tests) appeared significantly more generous after the earthquake than before. The
    psychological scientists were astonished “that these children could muster any measure of empathy and altruism while
    still living in the rubble of such a disruptive life experience” (Association of Psychological Sciences). Even under
    moments of intense stress people have demonstrated throughout history the ability to support others.

    It is completely normal to feel anxious, especially during this global event with so much uncertainty. However, make
    sure to take care of yourself both physically and mentally. We are all in this together!
